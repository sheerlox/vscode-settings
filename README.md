# vscode-settings

This repository holds my VSCode settings, extensions, keybindings, and profiles.

On Linux, this corresponds to the `~/.config/Code/User` directory.

The default profile's extensions is imported by [`sync_default_extensions.sh`](./sync_default_extensions.sh), because the default `extensions.json` is located outside of this directory (`~/.vscode/extensions/extensions.json`).
